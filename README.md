#### Research overview

In the high-stakes arena of interpersonal conflict, language transcends mere communication – it is a battleground for identity. Moving beyond observational and self-report methodologies dominating conflict research, this study pioneers computational mapping of disputants’ evaluative language patterns through Systemic Functional Linguistics (SFL)-based discourse analysis, establishing an empirical basis for characterising conflict styles.

Integrating Goffman’s dramaturgical theory of self-presentation, SFL’s Appraisal framework, and computational data mining methods, this interdisciplinary work explores the interpersonal functionality of evaluative language during dispute resolution. Central to this analysis is ‘attitudinal disposition’ – a speaker’s recurrent evaluative patterns that linguistically encode the attitudinal aspect of their conflict style. This approach not only demonstrates how disputants’ linguistic choices reflect adversarial identities but also crucially shows how these choices actively reconfigure conflict dynamics.
